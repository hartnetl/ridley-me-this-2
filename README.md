## Introduction
<hr>

Welcome to **Ridley Me This**  
This project is set up as a turtle sponsorship website, with the additional option to buy merchandise, give monetary donations or read up on turtle and eco living.  
The 7 species of sea turtle have different levels of endangerment. We need to ensure none of these worsen, and hopefully get them all to not endangered status.  
Users who sponsor a turtle do so for a year, and even get to give it a nickname for a year which is displayed on the website. A certificate of sponsorship and a special turtle themed gift is sent to each sponsor. The proceeds are then put towards the conservation effort to protect turtles.  

### Project Planning

#### Agile Development

The agile development process helps to keep a team organised and on track. It does this through monitoring the progress of the project and rating each feature and associated tasks by importance (from ones that are needed, ones that the project should have, and those that would be nice to have but not needed).  
An attempt was made to implement in this project, though admittedly because this was a solo project there was a tendency to track progress by handwiting to do lists etc over the github project setup.  That said, all issues were created based on user stories for the project requirements. These were broken into 6 different themes represented as 6 different project boards. Each project had 3 boards - to do, in progress and done. As the project progressed each issue card was moved between boards as its status changed. Issues were also given labels to declare an order of important - need, should and want labels.

By using this agile system it enables the team (or individual) to create the best functional application in the shortest possible time, as the project is frequently reassessed and completed in set time bouts. This ensures time isn't wasted on nice to have features while ignoring the features that are definitely required.

#### User Goals

As a site user I want to be able to:  

* View all products available on the shop to see what is available
* See a clear price so I know how much I'll spend
* Make a profile to keep track of previous orders and save personal information for speedy future checkouts
* Easily navigate around the site, and easily find the information / products I'm looking for 
* Purchase the items I can see on the site
* Know that the purchase was successful


As a site owner I want to be able to:

* Provide an aesthetically pleasing and easy to use website for users
* Offer a wide range of products to attract more customers
* Allow users to easily purchase my products, without the need to create an account
* Add, edit and delete products on the site as required
* Delete testimonials left by users, in the case of inappropriate content being posted.

## Web Marketing
<hr>

### Business Model

Ridley Me This is a not-for-profit e-commerce site. It allows users to sponsor turtles for a year, purchase merchandise and give monetary donations. 100% of cost is a profit which goes straight towards the conservation of the turtles. The delivery cost of the certificate and gift is covered by the user. There is a small profit made off of the merchandise, which goes straight towards conserving the turtles. Once again the delivery cost is covered by the user. There is nothing delivered when users make a donation, but by taking a 'delivery fee' for these transactions all processing fees are covered.


### Facebook Campaign

As Facebook tends to remove pages it believes to not be a functional business page, I opted to create a mock up of a would be Facebook page.

## Testing 
<hr>

### Manual Testing

The manual testing file is [here](Testing.md)


### Validation

html: [W3C markup validator](https://validator.w3.org/)   
Each page of the site was run through the validator. If errors were found the required changes were made until they could be removed.  
Unfortunately 2 warnings remain.  

<details>
<summary>Products Error</summary>

![products error](readmefiles/product-err.png)  

This error displays on the turtle and donations category page, but not the all products or merchandise donation page.  
I tried to find a solution where all 3 categories and the regular product page didn't have this error but ran out of time.  
</details>

<details>
<summary>Feedback Error</summary>

![feedback error](readmefiles/testimonial-err.png)  

This error displays on the testimonials page, despite the p tag being there. Couldn't find a solution for this.  

![feedback code](readmefiles/testimonial-err-1.png)  

</details>

<br>

CSS: [W3C validator](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/)  
All css was copied directly into the validator. No errors were found.  
<details>
<summary>View clear validator</summary>

![css validator with no warnings](readmefiles/css-val.png)
</details>   

<br>

Python: [pep8](http://pep8online.com/)  
All python files were validated by pasting the code directly. All errors found that could be removed were removed.
<details>
<summary>PEP-8 results</summary>

![pep8 no errors](readmefiles/pep-8.png)  

After going through the entire app to reduce the line lengths, some threw django errors afer satisfying pep8 requirements.  
Therefore it was better to revert to the longer line lengths and have some longer than usual lines.

![Error 501 - long lines](readmefiles/pep-8-err.png)  
Examples:  
* widgets.py - line 13 - template

</details>
<br>

JS: [JSHint](https://jshint.com/)  
All JS script was ran through jshint and fixes applied until no errors were found.  
<br>

Links: [w3c link validator](https://validator.w3.org/checklink)  
All pages were ran through the link validator. No errors were returned, but there was mention of the linkedin social link.

## Bugs
<hr>

### Fixed 

* Error when deploying  
Tried to migrate after swapping database, got error during migration:  
    django.db.utils.DataError: value too long for type character varying(2)  

Searched stackoverflow and found it's to do with model length   
Checked models, all good  
Check slack, a previous version of country field was max 2  
Edited migration file in error  
Migrate then worked  

* Creating formset - this was missing a line of code  

Error:  

        IntegrityError at /products/add/
        null value in column "price" of relation "orders_product" violates not-null constraint
        DETAIL:  Failing row contains (8, , , null, , null, null, , , null).
        Request Method:	POST
        Request URL:	http://localhost:8000/products/add/
        Django Version:	3.2
        Exception Type:	IntegrityError
        Exception Value:	
        null value in column "price" of relation "orders_product" violates not-null constraint
        DETAIL:  Failing row contains (8, , , null, , null, null, , , null).
        Exception Location:	/workspace/.pip-modules/lib/python3.8/site-packages/django/db/backends/utils.py, line 84, in _execute
        Python Executable:	/home/gitpod/.pyenv/versions/3.8.11/bin/python3
        Python Version:	3.8.11
        Python Path:	
        ['/workspace/ridley-me-this-2',
        '/home/gitpod/.pyenv/versions/3.8.11/lib/python38.zip',
        '/home/gitpod/.pyenv/versions/3.8.11/lib/python3.8',
        '/home/gitpod/.pyenv/versions/3.8.11/lib/python3.8/lib-dynload',
        '/workspace/.pip-modules/lib/python3.8/site-packages',
        '/home/gitpod/.pyenv/versions/3.8.11/lib/python3.8/site-packages']

* Order items not displaying on order history or email  
I deleted a line of code by accident for saving the line items when adding in the change turtle status and didn't notice.  
Adding it back in made this work again   


### Remaining

* The turtle sponsorship dates are linked to the date the product is added, not the date a user sponsors the turtle  
* Even though users can't add more than one turtle at a time, they can repeatedly add the same one to basket - I started trying to fix this but ran out of time before I could fully erase bug
