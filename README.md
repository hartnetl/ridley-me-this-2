## Introduction

Welcome to **Ridley Me This**. 

### Project Planning

#### Agile Development

Agile development helps to create an organised and efficient development plan to create a project which fulfills it's purpose. I have attempted to use this approach to build this project.  
This system requires a thorough project planning phase - deciding what the app is, and what the main goals of the project are. These are then developed into user stories, and features are built to address these user stories. To keep track of my development I created a user stories kanban board in github projects ([here](https://github.com/hartnetl/lord-of-the-recipes/projects/1)). I created an issue for each user story which was set to automatically display in my user story project. As I tackled each user story, it was moved to the in progress column. When I felt it had been completed it was moved to complete. Agile development also allows for the project to change. If the requirements have been met it is possible to revisit an issue to make changes or improvements to deliver the project in the best form possible.
